Hi, This is Dhritimaan Das, working as Artificial Intelligence Engr 2 at KLA Corporation. Before joining KLA, I was at Indian Institute of Technology(IIT-BHU), Varanasi where I pursued B.Tech in Electrical Engineering. During the four years of my Bachelor's studies, I luckily got a chance to explore the field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning and am lucky to have worked on some amazing projects in the domain. My undegrduate performance(a small success :) ) is all due to my family, support and guidance from my supervisors Pratik Sir and Anirban Sir and obviously friends:) who make life at college, what we call as "college life". I like to work on Computer Vision and Deep Learning based projects but I don't restrict myself to these only. I try to keep myself updated on latest ideas in the field of CV/DL and often seek to learn new technologies and concepts.

Apart from the curricular activities, I also love to play hawaiin guitar, listen to music and in sports I do have a mini-passion for badminton, cricket and swimming.
