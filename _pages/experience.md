#Project: Interpretable Online EMT Compensation using CycleGAN 

*Supervisors: [Dr. Anirban Mukhopadhyay](https://sites.google.com/site/geometricanirban/)*

Reformulated the problem of Error Compensation in Electromagnetic Tracking(EMT) Systems in the absence of line of sight as a density estimation problem. Proposed a novel approach using Generative Adversarial Networks which beats the SOTA approach for both online and offline error compensation

#Project: Data Imbalance in Sketch Based Image Retrieval Systems 

*Supervisors: [Dr. Soma Biswas](http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/people/faculty/soma.biswas/index.html)*

Worked on the challenge of training data domain imbalance in the multimodal system of
Sketches and Images. Implemented a Siamese auto-encoder based network stacked on top of a VGG-16 to
study its effect in Sketch-Based Image Retrieval Systems.


## Research Intern: CV Lab, ISI Kolkata


#Project: Unsupervised Image to Image Translation 

*Supervisors: [Dr. Ujjwal Bhattacharya](https://www.isical.ac.in/~ujjwal/)*

Worked on the problem of inter dataset Domain Adaptation in the context of foggy and
non-foggy images. Experimented using the architecture of CycleGAN to extract disentangling features from foggy images to learn the distribution shift between the domains.
